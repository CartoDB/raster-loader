Installing Raster Loader
========================

Raster Loader is available on PyPI_ and can be installed with pip_:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install raster-loader[all]

To install from source:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/cartodb/raster-loader
   cd raster-loader
   pip install .[all]

.. tip::

   In most cases, it is recommended to install Raster Loader in a virtual environment.
   Use venv_ to create and manage your virtual environment.

The above will install the dependencies required to work with both Snowflake and
BigQuery. In case you only want to work with one of them, you can install the
dependencies for each of them separately:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install raster-loader[snowflake]
   pip install raster-loader[bigquery]

After installing the Raster Loader package, you will have access to the
:ref:`carto CLI <cli>`. To make sure the installation was successful, run the
following command in your terminal:

.. code-block:: bash

   carto info

This command should print some basic system information, including the version of Raster
Loader installed on your system. For example:

.. code-block:: bash
