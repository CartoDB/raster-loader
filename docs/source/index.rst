Raster Loader
=============

The Raster Loader is a tool for loading GIS raster data to standard cloud-based data
warehouses that don't natively support raster data.

You can use this package in two ways:

* As a standalone tool using the command line interface.
* As a Python library that you can import and use in your Python projects.
